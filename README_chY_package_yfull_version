steps to use chY_package_yfull_version

1. download chY_package_yfull_version.py, yfull_tree_info.sav, full_snps.sav
2. locate files to where the program is executed
    e.g. using terminal, cd [directory path to file with downloaded files]
    e.g. locate downloaded files to same file as the python execution file in jupyter notebook
3. import the package from chY_package_yfull_version using terminal or jupyter notebook
    e.g. from chY_package_yfull_version import get_result
4. run the function to get result, using vcf file as input
    e.g. result = get_result(vcf_file_path)

Note: 
pandas, pickle, matplotlib_pyplot, numpy, networkx, json, requests should be installed by running "pip install package_name" in terminal if listed packages are not installed yet
vct_file_path is the file path to vcf file to analyze. 
vcf file should be formatted in following order: CHROM, POS, ID, REF, ALT, QUAL, FILTER, INFO
By setting update=True in get_result function, it is possible to update all information although it is time-consuming

The output of the get_result will include:
1. number of variants matched for each haplogroup
2. percentage of variants matched for each haplogroup
3. scores of fit to each haplogroup
4. path diagram showing which haplogroup is most likely
5. YFull link for more information

1,2,3 is shown as bar graph, where the clusters in the bar graph can be seen as haplogroups that the individual most likely belongs to.
4 is shown as tree diagram, where longest path formable from matched haplogroups is shown in red. longest path can be seen as a haplogroup that the individual most likely belongs to.
By viewing 5 (the link to YFull), it is possible to find out the region where the similar samples are from.
