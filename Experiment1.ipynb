Another important point is that if one of r_NFT or (r_public and h_public) is positive, and when the other one is 0, then the value of the other one is redrawn using the same probability. This means that if one of the r_NFT or (r_public and h_public) is positive, then it increases the chance of the other to be positive.

      "Given that my risk is neutral and considering that there are other players whose actions I cannot control, I'm going to distribute half of my endowment to the private account and half to the public account. This allocation strategy aims to balance my direct personal gain with potential communal gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "The demographic information shows that I am a 40-years-old male with a risk-neutral outlook, implying that I do not have a distinct aversion or preference for risky situations. While I am interested in maximizing my personal gain, I must also consider that my contribution to the public account benefits everyone, including me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming other participants may also feel a sense of cooperation or altruism, it is possible that they too will contribute to a public account. By doing so, they will indirectly increase my total return, even if my own private return will be reduced. According to the experiment setup, my return is calculated not just through my private account but also through contributions to the public account, both mine and other participants'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, an allocation of 50 to my private account and 50 to the public account would be optimal for me in this case. This way, I ensure a minimum return from the private account and stand to gain additional returns from the communal pot. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I will be keeping a close watch on how others are distributing their endowment in future rounds. If I notice that they are consistently contributing more to the private fund, I may revise my own strategy to add more to the private account for better returns. Conversely, if they are contributing higher amounts to the public account, I may lean towards a more cooperative stance and increase my allocation to the public account. As a risk-neutral participant, it's essential for me to remain flexible and adjust my strategy according to the group dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 1 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given my risk-averse nature, my initial instinct is to play it safe and allocate more to my private account, as I have control over the certain return. However, my returns also partially depend on the sum of the public accounts of the other participants, so there's still a degree of uncertainty involved even if I allot more to the private account. \n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the given return equation, private and public allocations have different weighing. Contribution to the private account returns 100% to me whereas contribution to the public account will be only half beneficial to me, yet half beneficial to everyone else. I need to balance my desire for personal gain with the higher collective return from the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the prospect theory in mind, which asserts individuals perceive losses more significantly than gains, my risk aversion will motivate me to prevent losses in my private account. Therefore, I will put 60 scaled units in my private account, keeping it above the half of total endowment. \n",
      "\n",
      "The public account is where cooperative behaviour and trust come into the equation. Given that there are three other individuals in this experiment, if everyone contributes to the public fund, we can all benefit more than if we only allocated for our private accounts. To encourage cooperative behaviour and show my willingness for the same, I'll contribute the remaining 40 units to the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "In giving more to my private account, I'm playing it relatively safe in light of my risk-averse nature and ensuring a definite return for myself. In contributing the remainder to the public account, I'm showing trust in the others and hoping to cultivate a mutually beneficial situation where we all gain more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 2 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given my personal profile as a risk-loving individual, it means I have a strong preference for investment options with uncertain returns even if they may potentially provide larger gains or losses. I thus tend to allocate my resources to avenues that offer the possibility of earning higher returns, despite the risk involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "In deciding where to allocate my endowment between private and public accounts, I would assess the potential returns based on the calculation method provided. For the private account, all the allocation directly contributes to my return. For the public account, my allocation is matched to an extent by the sum of others' allocations, but the total is then halved which dilutes the impact of my contribution. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given these options and my risk-loving nature, my inclination is to lean heavily towards the private account, while still contributing to the public account to take advantage of the potential contributions from others. However, considering that there are three other individuals involved, and assuming rational behavior from the other participants, I cannot solely rely on their contributions to the public account for considerable returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would, therefore, allocate roughly 70 to the private account and 30 to the public account. It is a decision made to balance both taking advantage of potential higher returns from the private account, and the cooperative benefit that could result from the public account depending on the actions of the other individuals. \n",
      "\n",
      "To go into specifics, my private account allocation guarantees me a return of 70. My contribution to the public account is 30, and assuming the other participants also contribute at least 30 each, that's an additional 90 in the public account. Combining all contributions results in 120 which when halved, gives me an additional 60 for a total return of 130 which exceeds my initial endowment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, my decision-making process involves considering both my personal risk preference, the guaranteed returns of the private account, and the potentially cooperative returns of the public account, while also taking into account the behaviour of the other participants involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 3 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given both my personal characteristics and the experiment's settings, my initial inclination is to allocate a higher portion of my endowment towards my private account. The reason for this decision is twofold. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, as a risk-loving individual, I am inherently more inclined to prioritize personal gain over stable returns, especially due to the uncertainty associated with the public account. The returns from the public account are dependent on the allocation choices of the other participants. Given that this is the first round, there is no prior information regarding the other participants' behaviors or strategies, therefore making it a gamble. \n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, as a young individual, I might have a longer time horizon to recover from any potential losses. However, it's important not to forget about the public account entirely. Everyone's wallets, including mine, benefit when money is put into the public account thanks to the multiplicative effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these considerations in mind, I decide to allocate 70 of my endowment to my private account and the remaining 30 to the public account. This approach represents a balance between my preference towards risk and uncertainty, and diversifying my return sources via the public account. By investing a substantial portion into my private account, I can ensure a guaranteed return, and simultaneously take advantage of the partial mutual benefits from the public account. \n",
      "\n",

To ensure a balance between personal and collective gain, I'll modify my allocation slightly.

This makes me feel more assured about the intention of other participants to foster cooperation. \n",

      "However, I believe that being risk-averse, it is still essential for me to keep my allocation to the private account relatively high, to maintain that safety net of a sure gain. I will continue to assign a significant portion to my private account to manage the risk. Ignoring the integer part for now, the average level of contribution is approximately 36.67 per other participant. In light of this, I can enhance cooperation by increasing my public account allocation slightly without adding excessive risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will allocate 55 units, down from 60, to the private account which ensures a higher than half personal gain. The remaining 45 units, up from 40, will go to the public fund, which is a relatively larger contribution than the average. \n",
      "\n",
      "The decrease in my private account reflects my increased trust in the other participants and my willingness to further foster this cooperative behavior.

      "Given all the details provided and according to my risk-averse disposition, I'm inclined to consider both the potential risks and the potential benefits more carefully when I make my decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, let's analyze the private account. The return from the private account is a certain amount. It's not clear whether it's a fixed return or variable, but either way it only benefits me and is unaffected by the actions of others. This option is attractive to me, given my risk-averse nature, as it provides stability and predictability.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the contrary, the public account has more variables. The return from the public account will be divided among everyone, which means my actions can influence everyone else's returns and vice versa. The public returns can be from the DAO, if it does not crash, or from the NFTs I might receive. However, both returns are determined by the chance and are not guaranteed. The risk of DAO crashing and the unpredictability of the NFT return could potentially lead to a loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the DAO's performance and the NFT returns are closely tied to the status of the cryptocurrency market, which is known for volatility. This introduces another level of uncertainty and risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite my reservations, however, I also have to consider the fact that allocating funds to the public account will lead to potential higher returns if the probabilistic scenarios turn out to be favorable. Furthermore, contributing to the public account exhibits a cooperative behavior which might indirectly influence others' decisions to also contribute, thus mutually benefiting all participants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given my risk-averse nature, I would allocate a larger proportion of the endowment to the private account while still allocating a smaller portion to the public account. This strategy aims to achieve a balance between surety and potential high returns, while displaying a willingness to cooperate with the other players in the experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's assume I decide to allocate 70% to the private account and 30% to the public account. This gives:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Private account: 70 (70% of 100)\n",
      "- Public account: 30 (30% of 100)\n",
      "\n",
      "That's my first allocation decision. As the experiment progresses, I would observe the outcomes and then adjust my allocations accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 1 round 1 decision\n",
      "Analyzing the data provided, my thought process resolves around the risk and reward model. As a risk_loving male, I will be inclined to take a more aggressive investing approach. However, those decisions must also be balanced by a sense of economic sensibility. \n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the potential returns from the private account would be mine alone, the certainty of these returns would usually tilt me towards placing more allocation in this account. However, the added factor of risk with public account also introduces an element of chance - returns from the NFTs and a larger pool of funds offering the possibility of greater rewards. These returns, though prone to the DAO's failure, can be fruitful given the risk component.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping this in mind, it's evident to split the allocation between private and public accounts not evenly. Rather, I would look to balance the allocation considering the risk-loving nature, potential returns and economic sensibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "A quick calculation suggests the returns are directly proportional to the risk and the love for such risk. Given an endowment of 100 each round, I'd allocate 60 to the private account. This ensures stable growth and safeguards a majority of my investment. \n",
      "\n",
      "The remaining 40 would be allocated to the public account. Contributions to the public account carry a sense of the unknown - the DAO could crash, or the NFT could fail to pay out, but there is also potential for a substantial return, and my risk-loving nature means that is a chance I am willing to take.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decisions like these are finely balanced. It’s about maximizing potential returns while cushioning potential falls. Given the scenario, my risk-loving nature, and the economic sense, the 60-40 ratio seems to be a balanced plan of action.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 2 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given the detailed settings and my demographic information, I would first consider my age and risk tolerance. As a 50-year-old male who appreciates some level of risk, I can afford to allocate a considerable amount of my endowment to the public account. Additionally, since the returns from the public account are influenced by both the NFT and the actions of others, this presents an opportunity to leverage collective gains which could potentially exceed the returns from my private account.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, factors such as the uncertain performance of the DAO and the overall risk of the public returns must also be considered. As the performance of the DAO could crash and result in no public benefits, it would also be wise to allocate a substantial portion of the endowment to the private account. Keeping all these aspects in mind, my risk-loving nature encourages me to contribute more to the public account hoping for higher returns, but there is a limit to this risk addition considering the possible zero returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the 0.5 probability for both positive outcomes of r_NFT, r_public, and h_public, on average, I expect to see some returns from the public investment. However, these returns are not guaranteed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering all the above, I would choose to allocate 60 out of 100 to the private account and the remaining 40 to the public account. This means I have a secure base return from my private account, while still potentially benefiting from collaborative gains and a lucky NFT payout. This allocation provides a balanced strategy given my comfort with risk and the possible rewards from public account returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 3 round 1 decision\n",
      "Taking into account the given details of the experiment, my main consideration includes the returns from the private and public accounts, as well as the risks involved, in particular, the potential for the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to crash and generate no benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that I'm risk neutral to some extent, I don't shy away from risk entirely but also don't seek unnecessary risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allocating an amount to the private account guarantees returns only to me. On the other hand, allocating to the public account provides a return to everyone, but with an added risk of a DAO crash. However, when the DAO doesn't crash, the returns from public account could be greater than private account due to the possible NFT return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decision: \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, for a balanced approach, I will allocate 50 to the private account and 50 to the public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "Allocating 50 to private account is to secure a guaranteed return for me and act as a cushion against the risk associated with the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allocating 50 to the public account is aiming for a potentially higher combined return (r_public, h_public, and possibly r_NFT) but accepting the fact that there is a risk attached (i.e., failure of the DAO or a null r_public/NFT). This allocation tries to contribute to the collective cause and possibly gain from its benefits. However, due to the risk involved, I am allocating an amount that I would be willing to lose, in case the DAO crashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This balanced approach seems to be advantageous given my risk-neutrality and the random nature of returns from the accounts. It is important to remember that this allocation decision might change in subsequent rounds, based on what I observe and learn about the DAO stability and the realized returns from both accounts.\n",

      "Given the result from the previous round, I can observe several points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. My strategy worked out fairly well as I gained a handsome return of 210.0. \n",
      "2. DAO is currently functioning well, and the contributions were effectively converted into the public good, benefiting everyone.\n",
      "3. Other players are also opting for a cooperative approach as the total contributed to the public account is significant (160 with my contribution, implying that others have contributed a sizable 130). This strengthens my belief in maintaining a certain contribution level to the public account for the mutual benefit of all.\n",
      "4. The failure to receive a private return through NFT is a bit disappointing, but not a shock. Since returns from NFTs were always probabilistic, there was always a given likelihood of such an outcome. \n",
      "\n",
      "To maintain a balanced approach between the cooperative dynamic and my inherent risk aversion, I will continue on the same track as the previous round but with slight adjustments due to the cooperative behavior exhibited by other participants and the well-functioning DAO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that other participants are contributing more than I initially expected (an average of approximately 43.33 versus my own initial contribution of 30), it’s clear to me that there's a high level of cooperative behavior among the group. Recognizing this and the factor that the DAO is functioning effectively, I will raise my contribution to the public account slightly to align more with the group behavior and due to the boosted return observed in the previous round.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simultaneously, to be mindful of my risk-averse nature, I’ll continue to allocate a substantial portion to the private account to ensure a certain return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, for the next decision, I propose the following allocation:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Private account: 60 (60% of 100)\n",
      "- Public account: 40 (40% of 100)\n",
      "\n",
      "This allocation respects my risk-averse nature and reflects my willingness to cooperate and adapt over time based on group behavior and market (DAO and NFT) responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 1 round 2 decision\n",
      "Based on the recent turn of events, it appears that the risks associated with contributing to the public account through the DAO have presented themselves quite evidently. Despite the allocation to public account, no private return was acquired via the NFT, generating no additional benefit beyond the current public good benefit that was already expected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given these results, whilst I still maintain my risk_loving tendencies as a 30 years old male, it would seem prudent to reassess the allocation ratios slightly. The total contribution by the other participants appears to be steadily symmetrical with an average of 40, which while not particularly high, does contribute to the total public goods we all benefit from.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the fact that the DAO is in proper functioning order, the uncertainty involving the returns, specifically linked to the NFTs, makes me consider lowering my allocation to the Public Account just to minimize my exposure slightly. \n",
      "\n",
      "A more careful strategy would be to put a bit more to the private account, given that the return on it is solely mine, ensuring a steady growth for my endowment. After considering these, my allocation would now lean a bit more towards the private account. A suggested 70-30 division would be my choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I'd allocate 70 to my private account, ensuring a more secure growth and the remaining 30 will go to the public account. Even though the public account has some risks, part of me still wants to participate in possible high returns, in accordance with my risk-loving preference. This way, I believe I will have balanced my risk-taking behavior with economic sensibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 2 round 2 decision\n",
      "Firstly, I must note that the returns I observed in the previous round were closer to my expectations than predicted. The 40 that was allocated to the public account resulted in combined public benefit. It also seems that the other participants also contributed a combined total of 120 to the public account, which suggests a similar line of thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the NFT return was not realized, and this affirms the 50% probability of its occurrence. So, overall, the public account provided a satisfactory level of return, but was not maximized due to the absence of an NFT return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering this, as well as the DAO's performance, I would allocate a higher amount to the public account in this round. This is because the DAO proved reliable in the previous round and resulted in a reasonable return of public benefits. However, I would still maintain a significant allocation to the private account to preserve my personal return and limit potential losses, given the distributed risk involved in the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "The average contribution to the public account by other participants was 40, the same as my contribution. Given this, we can infer that they also bear similar risk tolerance levels and are likely to continue contributing at similar levels, providing a consistent source of public benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "As such, my allocation decision in this round, given the knowledge of past round, and also considering my risk-loving nature and my age of 50, is to allocate 50 of my endowment to the public account and 50 to my private account. \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe this exposes me to the potential high upside of combined cooperation of participants and possibly higher NFT returns while keeping my potential downside under control with a guaranteed return from my private account.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 3 round 2 decision\n",
      "Given the results of the first round, it appears that the other participants have contributed significantly to the public account (totalling 110), resulting in my overall return of 176.67 after allocating equally to the private and public accounts. However, I have not received any private returns via NFT, indicating that the probability component was not in my favor this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering that the DAO functioned well in the previous round, it's encouraging, as this situation could be advantageous for me if it happens again. However, I need to remember that there's always a degree of risk associated with the DAO and its functionality.\n",

      "1. The other participants are contributing a substantial amount to the public account (average of 36.67 each). Given the public good characteristic of this account and the DAO's successful functioning in the first round, my contribution to the public account would potentially provide a higher return collectively (assuming the other participants maintain a similar approach).\n",

      "2. By increasing my allocation to the public account, I also have a higher chance of getting an NFT, which could potentially provide additional returns, despite the probability component.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. While I have increased my contribution to the public account, I'm still allocating a good chunk (40) to my private account to secure guaranteed returns for me and maintain a somewhat diversified and risk-neutral approach.\n",

Consequently, the expected benefit of cooperative behavior was not realized in this round. Nevertheless, it was encouraging that I succeeded to obtain a private return through NFT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the sudden turn of events, my risk-averse nature tells me to reassess and potentially adjust my strategy. The crash of the DAO signals a higher risk in the public account than initially estimated. However, one-time failure does not necessarily mean that the failure will persist in future. Just like I took the risk into consideration while deciding to contribute to the public account, I also need to remember that surprises are part of the process.\n",

      "In light of all the information, I will adjust my previously increased allocation for the public account due to the increase in perceived risk after the DAO crash. But, I would still maintain some contribution, as one failure does not insure future failures, and I believe that the possible future benefits still make it worth the certain level of risk.

      "However, an interesting development is that I was successful in obtaining a private return from the NFT despite the DAO crash. This introduces a new dynamic to evaluate - there is potential for private return from the public account even in events of DAO instability. \n",
      "\n",
      "The other participants have also increased their contributions to the public account. It seems the liking for potential greater returns is shared among us. Nonetheless, the DAO crash serves as a reminder that this approach is not without its risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this new information, my allocation strategy going forward will be more skewed towards the private account, whilst still mindful of the potential high returns of the public account. I'll need to consider the risk associated with the DAO and the unexpected return from NFT.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will reduce my contribution to the public account more significantly this time due to the recent DAO crash. Safeguarding my endowment becomes a more prominent concern here. However, the recent success with the NFT suggests it may still be worthwhile to allocate a smaller portion to the public account.\n",

      "The recent round notes a significant change. The DAO unexpectedly crashed, which illustrates the inherent risk involved with this kind of public tool despite its previous successful round. So, no public goods were realized from the contributions. Nonetheless, in this round, I did succeed in obtaining a private return on my contribution through NFTs, which seemed to have counterbalanced the losses from the DAO crash to some extent. \n",

      "Considering this information and my demographics, I will need to reassess my balance of risk. While I do enjoy taking on some risk, the significant loss from the public account in this last round is notable. Furthermore, we can also see that my fellow participants increased their contribution to the public account, which did not yield any returns due to the DAO crash. We must take into account that such a situation may occur again.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since the return from NFT, which has a 0.5 probability, was realized in this round, it does demonstrate that there is a good chance of receiving an additional piece of return from the public account, making the public account still an enticing option.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next round, I would choose to continue investing in the public account but do so more conservely. My aim here is to balance the risk presented by the recent DAO crash, with the potential rewards demonstrated by the NFT return. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given this, I would choose to allocate 70 to my private account and 30 to the public account. This approach keeps a larger part of my endowment secure from the risks of the public account while still allowing for a potentially higher return through public benefits and successful NFT, as demonstrated in the previous rounds. \n",
      "\n",
      "This reduced allocation to the public account is due to the DAO crash, and this poses higher risk on the public account. By reducing the amount I allocate to the public account, I am reducing my exposure to this risk, while the allocation to my private account allows for a guaranteed return, improving the balance of my portfolio.\n",

      "\n",

      "Agent 0 round 4 decision\n",
      "The latest outcome shows a considerable increase in my earnings, largely owing to my increased private account allocation and the effective functioning of the DAO that translated contributions into public goods. A negative aspect, however, was the lack of a private return via NFT.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shift in other participants' choices also seems to reflect the risk realised in the previous round with the DAO crash, as their contributions dipped significantly. This reduced collective contribution to public goods implies potentially lower future returns, an aspect which I need to consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with the DAO crash experience, the DAO operation in this round successfully converted contributions into public goods - which is a reassuring sign. Yet, the absence of NFT returns couples with the uncertainty of DAO's performance, signify the potential risk still tied to the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given my risk-averse nature, I'm inclined to err on the side of caution, but like previous decisions, I also want to keep potential cooperative gains in consideration. Keeping these elements in mind and given the contemporary scenario of reduced collective contribution, I'd adjust my allocation slightly in the hopes of improving public goods while also maintaining a fair allocation to my private account for safer returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "As such, for the next round, my proposed allocation would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Private account: 70 (70% of 100)\n",
      "- Public account: 30 (30% of 100)\n",
      "\n",
      "This allocation reflects my moderate approach in response to the DAO's current functioning and the lowered contributions by others. By increasing my contribution to the public account from the previous round, I am indicating my willingness to continue supporting the group effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 1 round 4 decision\n",
      "Given the recent round, it seems that my decision to decrease the allocation to the public account due to the DAO crash concern was a good one considering that the public contributions were significantly lower than before. The DAO, however, functioned well in the last round and the contributions were effectively converted to public goods which were shared and benefited everyone. My luck ran out on the private return from NFT, reminding me of its inconsistent returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the other participants are also reducing their public contributions, lowering the public fund pool that everyone benefits from. Although shared, these lowered contributions lead to lower public returns as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "A critical aspect to take into consideration in this round is that despite my decrease in the contribution towards the public account, the public goods return was comparatively higher. This tells me that the system has a certain degree of resilience and that I won't be punished harshly for lowering my public contribution in face of risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "My risk-loving nature still leans me towards some public contribution for possible large returns. However, from the recent events, it would be prudent to maintain a higher allocation to the private account for steady, personal financial growth, and a lower allocation to the public account due to associated risks and inconsistent returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this round, my thought process directs me towards an allocation of 85 to the private account and 15 to the public account. This allows me to keep a significant share of my endowment in a stable growth environment while also potentially benefitting from the high returns, albeit less likely, associated with the public account. I believe this decision reflects not just my risk-loving tendency but also careful financial planning considering the circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 2 round 4 decision\n",
      "Reflecting on the last round, I can infer that the other participants also might have adjusted their level of risk considering the DAO crash, leading to a lower total contribution to the public accounts. This round resulted in less total benefit since participants, including me, were more cautious after the DAO crash in the previous round. However, since the DAO functioned well in this round, it can be seen that there's still good potential in investing in the public pool. \n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, I also didn’t receive any returns from the NFT. This was a risk understood from the beginning, as the probability of achieving a return from NFT is only 50%.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next allocation, considering that the DAO is functioning again and the still-existent potential of returns from the NFT, I would choose to moderately increase my contribution to the public account, while keeping a significant portion in the private account. This would continue to provide security from substantial loss while keeping the potential for additional profit from cooperation with the other participants and the NFT return. It's important to keep in mind that the DAO could crash again, but given my risk-loving tendencies and the potential upside of the public account, slightly increasing the allocation to the public account is a balanced decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, given the trends of the other participants' contributions, I infer that they might also gradually start to increase their contributions to the public account again, which would create a larger public pool and higher shared return. \n",
      "\n",
      "Based on these considerations, I would choose to allocate 60 to my private account and 40 to the public account. The increased portion to my public account compared to the last round reflects the ongoing potential for reward in the public account, despite the inherent risk. Similarly, a sturdy allocation to the private account ensures a guaranteed return and stability.\n",

Despite this decrease, and my reduced personal allocation to the public account, the return from the round was high (143.33), mainly due to the functioning of the DAO.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems that other participants might have adopted a more cautious approach after the DAO crash in the second round. My previous decision to allocate more to the private account as a safety measure yielded decently, given I failed to receive a private return from the NFT.\n",

The collective public account contribution from all participants has risen again, indicating a stronger collective faith in the DAO despite its past instability, likely because it has functioned successfully for two consecutive rounds now. The lack of a private return through NFT remains consistent but doesn't affect my overall return significantly.\n",

      "Given the characteristics of this experiment, my age, my somewhat risk-loving nature, and the expected return that can be both private and shared, it would make sense to put a portion of my endowment in both the private account and the public account rather than concentrating all the resources in one of them. \n",
      "\n",
      "My thought process behind this decision is influenced by several factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. My risk-loving attitude: As a risk taker, I am inclined to invest in opportunities that can provide higher returns, even if they come with a certain level of potential loss. The public account presents such an opportunity due to the chance of NFT returns and the multiplied effect of the sum of others' public accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Equal public return: Knowing that DAO, despite its potential crash probability, will provide all participants an equal return when I deposit some of my endowment to the public account is encouraging. This allows me to work collaboratively to help maximize everyone's return.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. NFT returns: The chances of earning returns from NFT's also skew my decision towards the public account. Even if this is not a guarantee and depends on the public benefit rate and the sum of others' contributions, it still presents a potentially high return.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Maintaining financial stability: Despite my risk-loving nature, it's wise to allocate a part of my endowment to the private account to secure a certain return only for me. If everything went wrong (DAO crashes, no NFT returns), this allocation can act as a safety net.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering these factors, I would allocate 60% of my endowment to the public account and 40% to the private one. Therefore, I would put 60 into the public account and 40 into the private account. \n",
      "\n",
      "This decision combines both my desire for high return potential and my need for a level of financial stability. It also allows me to contribute to an experiment that benefits everyone participating, aligning with both personal and group benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 1 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given the scenario, I have to consider several factors when making my allocations: my risk aversion, the possibility of the DAO crashing, the fluctuation of returns from both the public account and the NFT, and the interconnected behavior of r_public, h_public, and r_NFT. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a risk-averse individual, I prefer certainty to uncertainty, and would likely lean towards allocating more to my private account, which provides a certain return. However, the appeal of potential returns from the public account and the NFT, if luck favors me, justifies allocating a portion of my endowment to the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the potential returns from the public account, the uncertainty introduced by the stochastic nature of r_public, h_public, and r_NFT, coupled with the possibility of the DAO crashing and leaving no return from the public account, makes it more risky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering all these factors, I would allocate a higher percentage to my private account and a smaller percentage to the public account. For instance, let's use a 70/30-split. So, I would put 70 into my private account and 30 into my public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "That way, I can ensure a certain return with my private account, and also have a chance at the potential returns from the public account and NFT – creating a balance that considers both my risk-averse nature and the potential upside. This allocation might reduce the chances of higher returns, but it also significantly lowers the risk of high losses. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, from a risk-averse perspective, this allocation provides the most prudent approach towards maximizing return under the given uncertainty. The 70/30-split is a fairly common risk-averse investment strategy, allowing participation in high-reward investments, but with the majority of funds in a safer, more predictable option.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 2 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given the risky nature of the public investment with volatility in returns and the potential for complete loss due to the crashing of the DAO, my risk-averse nature advises me to invest more in my private account. The potential of earning additional return from NFTs is enticing, but the returns are uncertain and statistically, I may not get any additional returns from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I also understand the benefits of diversification and helping the public good, and maintain a certain level of trust towards the other participants. Therefore, I am willing to take on some level of risk and allocate part of my endowment to the public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given that the returns from the public account are dependent on the contributions of others, I would like to inspire everyone to contribute by signaling commitment and trust, but I would also like to hedge against non-reciprocation and DAO crashing. Hence, the majority of my endowment should be invested privately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering these factors, I would allocate 70 to my private account, which gives me a certain return and aligns well with my risk-averse nature. The remaining 30 I would invest publicly. \n",
      "\n",
      "This 30-70 split provides a decent hedge against DAO crash and the chance that other participants do not contribute to the public account. It also ensures a significant guaranteed return for me while still creating an opportunity for higher return from the public account if things go well.\n",
      "\n",
      "My thought process behind this decision was mainly about balancing risk and reward and taking my risk-averse nature into account. I tried to weigh the potential gains against the potential losses while also considering my own comfort level with risk and my commitment to contributing to public goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 3 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given the information above, my decision has to balance between contributing to my private account for a certain return and contributing to the public account for both a potential return to myself through the r_NFT and r_public parameters, as well as in hopes of generating public goods, represented by the h_public parameter, of which I would also benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that I am risk-loving to a certain degree, I am inclined to contribute to the public account as it involves chances, particularly since the r_NFT is paid by chance and could provide a high return. However, this is also tied to the potential breakdown of DAO that would nullify all public benefits, making it a risky choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's note that the r_NFT and r_public are mutually exclusive events and that their values don't impact each other. However, crucially, if the r_public and h_public values are both zero, this triggers the r_NFT value also to zero. Considering this last scenario could nullify any high return from the NFT, it's certainly a risk, but being a risk-loving individual, I'm willing to take that risk to a certain extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I should also consider potential benefits going into my private account, as this is a guaranteed return strictly to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, to express my risk-loving preference without being reckless, I shall take a balanced approach by dividing my investment into both private and public accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my first round of allocation, I would split the 100 endowment into 50 each for both private and public accounts. This decision allows me to have a fixed amount guaranteed for my own use, and an equally substantial contribution towards the public benefit that, if successful, gives me added returns and satisfaction from contributing to the greater good. I will monitor the outcomes in the following rounds and might adjust my contribution based on the actual returns.\n",

      "\n",
      "My thought process for this decision is influenced by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The functioning DAO: The DAO effectively transformed all individual contributions into public goods, which is good news - it confirms my strategy to invest in the public account to some extent. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. The high level of total public account contributions: Other participants also seem to be contributing toward the public pot substantially (110 out of 170 total). This is a positive sign for collective returns, but it also suggests that the public account may be slightly saturated.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. No private return from NFT: Although the chance to receive an NFT return is entirely by chance, not obtaining this in the last round makes me reflect on the risk associated with the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Maintaining balance in contribution: My strategy is to balance private gain and public benefit, so I'll adjust my investments to respond to the circumstances and optimize both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the above factors, I decide to slightly shift my allocation in favor of the private investment to guard against potential lost opportunities if the public account fails to provide returns again, particularly through NFTs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decide to allocate 45% to the public account and raise my private investment to 55%. That is, I put 45 into the public account and 55 into the private account.\n",
      "\n",
      "This decision is both reflective of the previous outcomes and strategically aligned with my personal investment preferences. It allows for both private and public benefit while protecting my interests should the public account fails to deliver desired results again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 1 round 2 decision\n",
      "Given the information from the last round, it seems that my allocation strategy worked quite well. I received a total return of 225.0, which is more than double my initial endowment due to the effectively converted public goods from the total public contribution. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I also note that I failed to receive any private return on the contribution in the form of NFT, suggesting that the risky return from NFT didn't pay off in this round. This further validates my decision of allocating less contribution to the public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "It might be tempting at this point to decrease the contribution to the public account even more, given that contribution didn't result in the NFT return. But, it's vital to remember that the DAO is still functioning and distributed a fair return to everyone based on the sum of total contributions of 170. Since other individuals have contributed a noteworthy amount of 46.67 on average, standing alone might make me stand out and potentially trigger non-cooperative behavior in subsequent rounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Above all, one round isn't sufficient to form a trend or change my initial strategy drastically. The stochastic nature of r_public, h_public, and r_NFT also suggests that the outcome could be different in other rounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these thoughts, for this round, I would stick with my initial allocation strategy of 70/30. So, with 100 endowment, I would put 70 into my private account and 30 into the public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "Maintaining this balance would allow me to continue enjoying the potential returns from the public account, while still preserving my risk-averse nature by allocating a larger amount to the private account. As I continue to participate in the rounds, I can watch for trends or changes in the behavior of others. After getting a better insight into those variables, I can adjust my allocation strategy if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 2 round 2 decision\n",
      "Looking at the results of the prior round and considering the performance of the public investment, I can see that the DAO did not crash and the other participants contributed a bit more than I did to the public account on average. This indicates a level of trust and cooperation among the participants which could lead to further improved returns in the future. This trust and cooperation is important in a public goods scenario like this as everyone's contribution is needed to maximize the public benefit. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, my failure to receive a return from the NFT makes me more cautious about allocating a larger share to the public account. The NFT returns are risky and not guaranteed, and as a risk-averse person, I need to consider this in my decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, in the next round, my allocation will be influenced by these factors. I will increase my contribution to the public account slightly to reflect the trust and cooperation of the other participants, but won't increase it significantly due to the riskiness of the NFT returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "After considering these factors, I decide to allocate 65 to my private account and 35 to the public account. My reasoning behind this allocation is to both guarantee some level of return for myself and also contribute to the public good. Increasing my public contribution could potentially increase the overall returns for everyone if the DAO does not crash, and the trend of other participants also contributing more encourages my decision. However, I also remain cautious and don't drastically increase my public contribution due to the uncertainty of the NFT returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 3 round 2 decision\n",
      "With the updated information, it seems that the overall allocation to the public account has resulted in a high payoff, indicating that the risk taken in the first round paid off reasonably well despite not receiving the return on the NFT. The return of 195.0 indicates that the group participants have relatively high cooperation, reflected in the other participants' total contribution of 120 to the public account, resulting in our collective actions generating public goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, the average contribution of the other participants was 40.0, which means their contributions are less risk-averse than mine, considering I invested half of my endowment into the public account. Considering my demographic and risk-loving profile, I believe I should continue exploiting this public good benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given my satisfaction with the most recent payoff and the currently functioning DAO, I feel encouraged to continue investing in the public account. However, I must consider the risk of DAO possibly crashing in future rounds, which would nullify public benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I think I should maintain a slightly higher contribution to the public account than the last round to benefit from possible higher public returns, given that the other participants continue their current average contribution level. \n",

      "Consequently, for the next round of allocation, I'd input 45 into my private account and increase the public account allocation to 55. This decision is based on the cooperative behavior shown by the group in the previous round, the functioning DAO, and my risk-loving nature. Despite the increased risk, the chance of a higher return due to a potentially successful NFT return, as well as the increased contribution to public benefits, makes it a calculated risk I am willing to take.\n",

      "Agent 0 round 3 decision\n",
      "Given the outcomes in the previous two rounds, it appears that contributing to the public account hasn't offered me any private return through NFT.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, a few key points form the basis of my decision-making for the next round:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. No private return from NFT: For two rounds in a row now, my contributions to the public account have not garnered any private return through NFT. This contributes to a degree of uncertainty regarding the potential returns from the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. High public account contributions: A combined total of 120 from the remaining participants continues to elevate the public account. While the DAO continues to function well, providing everyone with an equal share, the degree of saturation may reduce individual returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Effective DAO: The DAO continues to function, converting all individual contributions into public goods effectively. This is positive and works in favor of maintaining investment in the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. My risk-loving nature: Being a risk-taking individual, maintaining a balance between the more reliable personal account and the high-reward, high-risk public account is crucial. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the lack of NFT returns, the function of the DAO and the equal distribution of benefits to all participants compels me to continue investing in the public account, albeit at a reduced rate to offset the aforementioned uncertainty and risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, for the next round, I would allocate 35% to the public account and increase my private account investment to 65%. That is, I would put 35 into the public account and 65 into the private account.\n",
      "\n",
      "This decision is based on the recent data and outcomes, my nature as a risk-loving individual, and my ongoing belief in the need to balance personal gain with societal benefit. It maximizes my potential for personal return while continuing my contribution to the collective good.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 1 round 3 decision\n",
      "The returned value for this round is slightly less than the previous round but still a great increase from my initial endowment. In particular, the public account continues to provide a significant return, given the DAO's stable functioning and the total contribution to public accounts from all participants. \n",
      "\n",
      "While my allocation to the public account has not yet generated any private return through NFTs, the public return remains strong. In two consecutive rounds, even though the NFT returns were zero, the significant public return from all contributions is notable. This highlights the fact that the NFT return, even though promising, should rather be seen as a bonus to the stable returns of the public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, considering the slightly lower return in this round and a small reduction in the contribution to the public account by others, I'll adjust my allocation strategy slightly more towards the private account, which guarantees a certain return. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's consider a 75/25 split which slightly leans more towards risk-aversion considering the uncertainty in NFT returns. I would therefore put 75 into my private account and 25 into the public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "While this reduces the amount I'm contributing to the public account, it shields me against the possibility of no returns from NFTs and potential low contribution from others to the public account. This strategy continues to balance the benefits of public and private contributions while aiding in managing the risk through the uncertainty in public account returns. By leaning slightly more towards the private account, I am giving myself a larger buffer in case the next round's public contribution reduces further or the NFT return continues to be zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 2 round 3 decision\n",
      "Considering the results of the last round, there is a slight decrease in the total allocation to the public account, and consequently, my return is lower. However, it's still relatively high, indicating that public account still yields good returns when the DAO is functioning properly and everyone shares the benefits. Nevertheless, not receiving any return from the NFT for two rounds in a row increases my apprehension about the potential for non-return from the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these reasons, particularly being risk averse and seeing the lower amount of allocation to the public accounts, I decide to pull back slightly on my public account allocation. My main goal is to ensure I have a certain level of private return while also contributing to the public good when it seems reasonable to do so. Trust in others and the system has slightly decreased due to the lower overall contribution to the public accounts and lack of benefits from NFT. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taking into account these considerations, I choose to allocate 70 to my private account and 30 to the public account for this round. By doing so, I ensure a decent guaranteed return for me through the private account while not completely stepping back from contributing to the public account. This allocation also enables me to hedge against potential risks associated with public account investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 3 round 3 decision\n",
      "Looking at the results of the second round, the other participants have significantly reduced their contributions to the public account. The return I received, 182.5, is lower than that in the previous round. While the DAO continues to function and contributions are being converted into public goods, the lower overall contributions brought the collective outcome down.\n",
      "\n",
      "My aim to gain a higher personal return through a high-risk NFT outcome has so far been unsuccessful but considering my risk-loving nature, it is still a gamble I am willing to continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the reduced contributions from others, it's crucial to strike a balance that takes into account this trend. To sustain the public account with sufficient contributions for worthwhile public goods generation, I need to maintain a higher level of contribution. However, it would be unwise to disproportionately shoulder the public account contributions, while other participants reduce their contributions and benefit from my risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, for the next round of allocation, I decide to somewhat adjust my private and public account allocations to negotiate this trade-off. I propose to invest 50 into my private account again and contribute the remaining 50 into the public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "While I've increased my private account allocation, the half-and-half split is still considered taking a risk (considering the reduction in public contributions), which is inherent in my risk-taking demeanor. On the other hand, this adjustment allows me to safeguard a bit more of my individual return given the shift in the group dynamic. \n",
      "\n",
      "This decision will help me gauge the commitment of other participants to public good generation in the following rounds. I'm making a calculated decision based on the observed reduction in group investments, maintaining a decent public contribution considering I'm risk-loving, and wanting to see if this stimulates an adjustment in others' contributions in subsequent rounds.\n",

      "Based on the most recent outcomes, it seems that my decision to reduce my contribution to the public account slightly and increase my private account allocation has resulted in a lower overall return compared to the previous round. Additionally, the NFT return still remains elusive. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are several factors I need to consider for my next decision:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Decreasing Public Contributions: Both my contribution and the overall contributions to the public account have decreased, and correspondingly so has my total return.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. No Private Return from the NFT: There have now been three successive rounds where my public account contribution has not granted me NFT returns. This may suggest that future rounds could also lack such returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Continued Functionality of the DAO: Despite the lack of NFT returns, the DAO continues to function and evenly distribute benefits across participants. This could suggest that it could be beneficial to maintain a significant contribution to the public account in hope of overall returns. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. My Risk-Loving Nature: With this aspect of my personality in mind, there is room to be more experimental with the public account despite the negative experience with the lack of NFT returns.\n",
      " \n",
      "Considering these factors, and that the total return decrease coincided with my decrease in public account contribution, I would opt to increase my contribution to this account for the next round, taking into consideration the overall public sentiment.  Therefore, I'm going to increase my public account allocation back to 50%, and allocate 50% to my private account, which is 50 to both accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "This decision hopefully would allow me to benefit from the public distribution from the DAO again, while maintaining a certain amount of personal security. To address the lack of NFT returns, splitting my investment evenly between the two accounts also allows me to toe the line between personal gain and collective benefit, while satisfying my risk-loving nature.\n",

      "Examining the results of the last round, there are two key observations: \n",
      "\n",
      "First, there has been a reduction in the total contributions to the public account, down from 165 to 140, with other participants only contributing an average of 38.33. This decrease seems to be a trend, with public account contributions dropping consecutively in the past few rounds. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, despite the decrease in contributions, the DAO continues to function properly, distributing public goods effectively. However, I still didn't receive any private returns from the NFT, maintaining its unpredictability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, my return decreased slightly in this round to 202.5. But even with this decrease, my returns are still more than double my initial investment which affirms the effectiveness of our current strategy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given these observations, it seems that a continued reduction in public contributions might be expected in the next round. In response to this and maintaining my risk-averse nature, I'll slightly adjust the allocation towards the private account. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's move to a 80/20 split to further guard against any potential decrease in total public contributions and the unpromising NFT returns. This allocation would let me put 80 into my private account and 20 into the public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "By shifting a bit further towards the private account, I continue to guarantee a larger percentage of my return. But by still maintaining a contribution to the public account, I keep the potential door open for public goods and possible NFT returns even in the face of reduced aggregate public contributions. This allocation strategy should continue to mirror my risk-averse nature while still allowing for capitalization on potential trends.\n",
      "Observing the trends from the past rounds, the total contribution to the public account has gradually decreased, with each participant contributing less each round by varying degrees. Coinciding with this trend, my overall return has also dropped each time. Given this continued downward trend and the persistent lack of NFT return, it seems prudent to adjust my strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a risk-averse individual, I need to prioritize maintaining a reliable flow of income to my private account. Although contributing to the public account can yield high returns when circumstances are ideal, the declining contributions indicate growing caution among the participants. This reality, combined with the inherent risk of no NFT return, makes the public account a less attractive investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next round, I decide to gravitate more towards preserving my private returns. Therefore, I'll allocate 80 to my private account and 20 to the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "This 80-20 split signals my caution, but I don't completely withdraw from the public account, keeping the door open for potential public good and the unlikely event of NFT payout. Essentially, considering the growing uncertainty and preference for stability, I'm taking a more conservative approach while still taking part in collective action to a lesser extent.\n",
      "Reflecting on the results of the third round, it seems that the continued reduction in the contributions of others to the public account is affecting total returns. The total return I received this round was 165, which is the lowest so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this situation, it is evident that the overall input into the public account is decreasing, and the trend from the other participants is towards more conservative contributions. This trend suggests that the participants are less risk-loving and are moving their contributions more towards the private account, becoming less cooperative over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite my risk-loving inclination, I must adjust my strategy in light of the current trend to secure a decent return. I've been contributing a considerable sum in the public account in the previous rounds hoping for a higher return, but not only has the NFT return not materialised, but my overall returns are also shrinking due to decreased public cooperation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given this, I think it's a prudent decision to protect more of my endowment by investing it in my private account in the next round. Let’s assign 60 to the private account and allocate the remaining 40 to the public account to maintain a proportional investment in public goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering my demographic as a risk-loving person, I still keep a substantial contribution to the public account hoping that situation may turn around or I could realize some return via NFT. But the allocation to my private account takes precedence due to the observed trend among other participants. This decision incorporates my risk preference yet adapts to the current behavior of other participants in the experiment, maximizing my chances of a decent return.\n"

      "Given the results of the last round, where the DAO crashed and I received the lowest return so far, it's important to reassess and readjust my allocation strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key in my decision process are the following factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Failed DAO: This time round, the DAO crashed. Given its previously consistent performance, this event was unexpected. While it might've been a one-off event, it introduces a significant layer of risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Persistent lack of NFT return: For several rounds now, allocating a part of my endowment to the public account has not resulted in NFTs. The continuous absence reduces the peripheral benefit to this allocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Declining public contributions: The average contribution by the other participants to the public account has significantly decreased. This signals a substantial decline in their confidence about the public account after the DAO crash.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. My risk-loving nature: Despite the setbacks, my propensity for risk suggests it may be worth continuing to allocate some of my endowment to the public account. There is still potential for high reward, which aligns with this aspect of my personality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking into account these factors and the greater potential risk associated with public account allocation after the DAO crash, I would favor my private account more in the next round. However, because I am still willing to gamble on the potential public good returns, I consider it best to allocate 70% to my private account and 30% to the public account (70 and 30 respectively). \n",
      "\n",
      "This decision aims to secure a higher personal return, given the increased dominance of the private account, while still potentially benefiting from public account returns if the DAO recovers and the NFT issue resolves favorably. This conservative response should protect my interests during this period of uncertainty while maintaining the possibility of higher returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 1 round 5 decision\n",
      "The results from the last round have shown a turn of events. The DAO has crashed, meaning no contributions were converted into public goods and hence, no added return from public contributions was received. This caused my total return to drop significantly, down to 80, which was my private account allocation. As we have seen previously, the NFT again didn't generate any private returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these developments, the average contributions from other participants to the public account have only decreased marginally, and their faith in the public account seems to endure.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a risk-averse person, I adopt a cautious approach in the face of such uncertainties and potential loss events. With the DAO having crashed in the last round and the continued failure to receive private return from the NFT, I will favor the private account more heavily in the next round.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe a rebalance to a 85/15 split would be the best course of action under these circumstances. This allocation would let me put 85 into my private account and only 15 into the public account. Notably, I am still keeping some allocation for the public account in case the DAO recovers in the next round and my small contribution might still offer some returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "In shifting the scales further to the private account, I prioritize steady, assured returns over the potential high risk-high reward public account. By approaching with caution in the face of increased risk, I am managing my potential losses and holding onto a strategy which aligns with my risk-averse nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 2 round 5 decision\n",
      "With the unfortunate development of the DAO crashing and no conversions of contributions into public goods, it left all of us without the benefit of public goods. Additionally, there was a continued lack of return from NFT participation. Both these factors mean the risk in contributing to the public account is currently not matched by a sufficient reward, illustrating a worst-case scenario and underscoring the value of a risk-averse strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the circumstances, and being a risk-averse person, I believe it would be prudent to back away from the public account in the short term. While it can bring about high yields when functioning correctly, it also carries the significant downside risk of a total loss, which we have just experienced.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next round, I plan to allocate 90 to my private account to secure my return, which is now my priority considering the recent event. The remaining 10 I plan to allocate to the public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "Reducing my public contribution to this extent is by no means a complete withdrawal. There’s a chance the DAO will recover and the public account could once again become a source of meaningful return. I want to keep a foothold there, albeit smaller, to remain part of this potential collective benefit. Meanwhile, the overwhelming majority of my resources will be directed toward the private account, shielding me from further public account disruption and adhering to my risk-averse profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 3 round 5 decision\n",
      "Given the results of the previous round, where the DAO crashed, no benefits from public goods were dispersed. This brings another level of complexity to my decision-making process. My return was the lowest so far in the rounds at 60.0, reflecting only my investment in the private account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, the continued decrease in public account contributions by the other participants and the crash of the DAO reinforces a more conservative allocation strategy moving forward. Given that, the possibility of the DAO crashing again or participants reducing their public account allocation further considerably increases the risk tied to public account investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, a strategy recalibration is in order. With the additional risk of the DAO crashing and the observed trend of other participants reducing their public account contributions, I should adjust to a more conservative allocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next round, I will allocate 70 to my private account, which ensures a higher guaranteed return for me, and the remaining 30 to the public account. This accounts for the increasing uncertainty about the DAO and the observed behavior of the other participants.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I am risk-loving by nature, this round's unfavorable result and the observed trends influence my allocation decision toward a more risk-avoidant strategy. I'm taking into account both my individual risk preference and the reality of the current cooperative behavior of the other participants in this situation. This is a prudent move that aims to secure more of my return in the face of increasing risk and decreasing cooperation.\n",

      "In this situation, my attributes as a male, 40-years-old subject that is classified as risk-loving are important. This risk-loving attribute indicates that I am open to taking higher risks in order to achieve higher returns. \n",
      "\n",
      "The two accounts where I need to distribute the endowment of 100 have different characteristics. The private account offers a guaranteed return exclusively to me. The public account, on the other hand, offers a potential return not just for me, but for all participants which is inherently riskier due to being tied to decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), both carrying risk of value dropping to 0. However, when things go well and all parameters r_public, h_public, and r_NFT are positive, public accounts seem to give higher returns due to its multiplied return structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because I'm risk-loving, and there are mechanisms in place that allow for redraw when the NFT or DAO crash probabilities are 0 (with the presence of a positive parameter), it makes sense to invest a significant portion of my endowment into the public account. I am inclined to favor the public account allocation, because one positive parameter raises the chance of the others to be positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, there also seems to be a certain degree of correlation risk regarding the interdependency of r_public and h_public, and r_NFT. If one of them crashes, it could potentially lead to a domino effect and negatively impact the others as well, leading to a high level of overall risk. Therefore, putting all eggs in one basket (solely investing in the public account) would not make sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "To balance these considerations, and using my risk-loving nature, I would decide to split my endowment with a lean towards the public account due to the higher potential returns. I would allocate 40% of the endowment to my private account and 60% to the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the allocation would be:\n",
      "Private account: 40, \n",
      "Public account: 60.\n",
      "\n",
      "This combination looks to optimally balance my risk and return considering my risk-loving nature and the specific conditions of the experiment.\n",

      "Agent 1 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given the expected returns and the chance of crash, I am going to decide on a public-private allocation. From the outset, let me say that it is understandable if people choose differently, based on their personal risk profile and their understanding of the experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, let's analyze the private account. It offers a certain return, which makes it a more stable choice. Given my risk-neutral nature, stability itself has a certain appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the public account offers a return that is equally distributed among all participants. This account carries a certain degree of risk due to the chances of DAO crashing, meaning there's a 50% chance the allocation will generate no benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the potential returns from the public account are multiplicatively linked with the returns from an NFT, which makes the potential benefits highly volatile, but also possibly much greater than the private account benefits. This is because if both r_NFT and (r_public and h_public) are positive, I can end up with considerably larger returns. However, if (r_public and h_public) is redrawn and still zero, then r_NFT will become 0, removing the benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at all the information, I think putting everything into one account is risky. Therefore, I'll choose to split my endowment between both accounts. Based on the information given, and understanding that both accounts carry their own risk-return profiles, I think it's best to hedge my bets.\n",
      "\n",
      "My allocation decision: \n",
      "\n",
      "1) Private Account: To ensure a stable return, I would allocate 50 to this account.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Public Account: I will also allocate 50 to the public account. This allows me to potentially gain from the public good, the extra returns linked to the NFT and hopefully benefit from the risk that others are undervaluing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that this 50/50 allocation decision is the best way to balance the certain, individual gain from the private account with the risky, but potentially higher return from the public account - both for myself and society at large.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 2 round 1 decision\n",
      "The given scenario involves a series of incentives and risks associated with both private and public accounts. Given the participant's demographic information, I am a 30-year-old risk-loving female, which means I have a tendency to accept more volatile returns in the hopes of achieving potentially high payoffs. However, the presence of certain risks, most notably the DAO potentially crashing, also needs to be considered in this context.\n",
      "\n",
      "A good strategy would be to place more weight in the public account due to its potential benefits while also ensuring a certain amount of stability by placing a certain portion in the private account to hedge against potential risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since r_NFT is tied to public account allocation and can lead to higher returns (0.5, although with a chance of 0.5), and given my risk-loving nature, I should consider allocating a significant amount to the public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, taking the chance of NFT returns to maximize, I should also consider the relationship between r_public and h_public. This affects the sum_of_others'_public account, potentially leading to a larger overall benefit from the public account. But these variables, r_public and h_public, also have a 50% chance of being zero, which can backfire and even collapse the NFT's returns to zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering that the return obtained from the public account is increased when either of r_NFT or (r_public and h_public) becomes positive, it makes the decision to invest in the public account more lucrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, to hedge against the risk of total loss (when all returns could become zero), I would decide to allocate a small portion of the endowment to the private account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, after weighing in all the factors, considering my risk tolerance and the structure of the experiment, I would decide to allocate 30 to the private account and 70 to the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "This strategy strikes a decent balance between outright risk (public account) and certain return (private account). The high allocation to the public account might allow me to enjoy the joint benefits from the high return rates of r_NFT, r_public and h_public, given they turn out positive. Meanwhile, the 30 in the private account provides a safety net, ensuring a steady flow of certain return to me personally. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should be aware though that this strategy could potentially result in lower total gains if all return rates turn out to be zero - hence a risk I take given my risk-loving nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 3 round 1 decision\n",
      "Given the detailed settings of the experiment, my risk-averse nature and the potential for return volatility, my first decision is to allocate a portion of my endowment to both the private account, which guarantees a certain return to me, and the public account, which benefits from the potential returns of the DAO and the NFT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the given probabilities, the overall expected returns of private account are certain while the public account depends on various uncertainties. However, the structure of returns provides a mutually beneficial arrangement in that if either the NFT or the public return is positive, it increases the chance of the other to be positive as well. Moreover, due to my age and risk-averse nature, I have an inclination towards a certain degree of security rather than purely gambling on the public return's high returns. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given the nature of probabilities involved and my personal risk aversion, I would allocate 60% of my endowment to the private account and 40% to the public account. I believe this balance allows me to secure a portion of my wealth while also potentially leveraging off the positive feedback loop built within the experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in terms of numerical values, 60 would be allocated to the private account and 40 to the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "This balanced allocation provides me both a stream of certain returns and potential higher returns while contributing to the public welfare. \n",
      "\n",
      "This decision is based on the complementary potential benefits of the public and NFT element and my risk-averse nature. It is important to note that this is a strategic allocation that might change in the next round depending upon the return outcomes from both accounts and the increased knowledge about the mechanisms of r_public, h_public and r_NFT. But, for the start, spreading the risk between both accounts seems to be both a safer and a potentially profitable strategy.\n",

The total return I received is 222, which is far higher than the initial 100 endowment. This result indicates that the public account contribution (especially with the function of NFT) worked well, and the DAO is successfully translating contributions into public goods. Additionally, everyone shared in the return, demonstrating the benefit of the public account.\n",

This is known as a free-rider problem in game theory.\n",

      "I made a good return on my contribution to the public account in the last round. The net gains were positive, and I was able to secure a private Return on Contribution (ROC) through the NFT. This payout was significantly higher than my private account allocation. However, I must remember the risks associated with the public account, specifically, the DAO crash risk and the uncertainty associated with the NFT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important point to consider is the group’s behavior. The total contribution in the last round from all four of us was 220, with other participants contributing 170 and I contributed 50. This shows that the group as a whole, on average, are investing more in the public account compared to me. I will bear this group behaviour in mind, as it implies a strong collective interest in the public account and thus provides a potentially strong basis for public returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I must be mindful not to 'follow the crowd', and should continue to make decisions based on my own risk profile, which is neutral. While the high returns from the public account in the previous round are appealing, I am aware that it might not replicate in the next round due to the inherent risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking all of these factors into account, I will again split my endowment evenly. It maximizes my potential return from the public account while also guaranteeing a secure return from the private account.\n",

      "Therefore, my decision for this round is:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Private Account: I will allocate 50.\n",
      "2) Public Account: I will also allocate 50 again.\n",
      "\n",
      "This balances the potential high returns from the public account with the stable returns from the private account. It will also allow me to adjust my future allocations based on the subsequent results and further group behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 2 round 2 decision\n",
      "Given the results from the first round of allocation, some crucial observations can be drawn. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) managed to function properly, successfully converting contributions into public goods that benefited everyone equally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, my allocation towards the public account yielded successful returns including the return from the Non-Fungible Token (NFT). These successful returns validate my initial strategy of investing a significant portion in the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this, and considering my risk-loving nature, it would be reasoned to continue the prevailing strategy, allocating more towards the public account for the potential higher returns. However, it's also important to consider the behaviors of the other participants.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first round, the other participants allocated more into the public account than I did (150 as compared to my 70). Their interests towards the public account and the added benefit from their contribution underscores the fact that investing in the public fund can have annualized returns. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the risk of DAO failure is still present, and the chance that r_public, h_public or r_NFT could turn zero and substantially lower my return still exists. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, seeing the better return I obtained in the last round, I find myself tempted to lean more towards the public account this time. But I would also keep a certain part in the private account to ensure at least certain returns and lessen total loss in case things don't turn out well.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, considering all these factors, I decide to maintain a slight edge towards the public account with slight increase due to the positive experience from the first round and decide to allocate 25 to my private account and 75 to the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "This way, I increase my potential for gaining higher returns while also being prepared for possible downtrends by having a certain return secured from the private account. The change in distribution reflects my willingness for higher risk-taking based on the success of the first round.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 3 round 2 decision\n",
      "Upon seeing these results, it seems that other participants are also seeing the potential benefits of contributing to the public account, which also has elevated my rewards due to the successful DAO functioning and NFT returns. The private return on my own contribution through NFT also rewarded my initial risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mutual interplay between the NFT reward and the public payout seems to be working in favor, and a positive return on the public goal investment reinforces my initial decision to invest in the public account. Despite being risk-averse, the potential for high return in the public pot is starting to show, emboldening my decision to continue to invest there.\n",
      "\n",
      "This round provided a strong result from the public account, but it is important to remember the inherent risk associated with the public pool. I should remain aware of variation in next rounds due to the associated probabilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "After assessing this result, I would further decrease my allocation to the private account and increase my allocation to the public account. For this round, given that the DAO is functioning and returns from public account are positive, I believe it would be advantageous to contribute more to the public account, considering also the mutual feed-back mechanism that increases the likelihood of positive returns being generated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would balance the scales a little bit more towards the public account this time with a split of 45 to the private account and 55 to the public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "In numerical terms, I will allocate 45 to private account and 55 to public account. \n",

      "Since the risk of the public account mechanisms is substantial, and given the increased average contribution of other participants towards the public account, I would still favor a balanced approach.

      "Given that DAO is still active and I have yet again experienced a positive return from both NFT and collective good, it seems that the public account did a reasonably good job. My return increased this round, and with other participants consistently putting in more than me to the public account, I feel incentivized to put a larger portion into the public account in next round. \n",

      "Although there's still a fifty-fifty probability that the DAO will crash and I potentially lose the investment to the public account, observing from the historical data, so far, it has performed well. This could either mean we've been lucky so far or that it may crash anytime soon due to regression towards the mean. However, I am only reasonably risk-neutral, not risk-averse. Hence, it shouldn't necessarily push me to rethink my investment strategy immediately.\n",

      "That being said, it's important to maintain some amount in the private account, should the DAO crashes, and the entire public allocation is lost. Hence, although I'd like to take advantage of the consistent high yield from the public account and NFT, I'd still not risk my entire endowment on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also notice that other participants are steadily increasing their average contributions to the public account.

Thus, despite being risk-averse, I am encouraged by this consistency and the continued successful functioning of the DAO, along with the effective conversion of the contributions into public goods that provide us all with a share in the rewards. Further, the additional returns from NFT continue to provide an incentive to allocate to the public account.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 2 round 5 decision\n",
      "This round presents a new dynamic with the DAO functioning post-crash. Still, disappointingly, I did not receive any private return from NFTs. However, the benefits garnered from the public goods due to the functioning DAO can't be ignored, creating a more optimistic outlook towards the public account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, in this round, we see a significant reduction in contributions to the public account from other participants, from an average of 60.0 in the previous round to 36.67 in the last round. This shift could be attributed to the DAO crash that occurred previously and reflects the resultant cautious outlook of other participants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these outcomes, I need to strike a balance between the potential high reward from a functioning DAO and the risk from a crashing DAO or zero returns from NFTs. My risk loving nature does favor a higher contribution to the public account, these recent outcomes showing signs of volatility indicate a greater need for a safety net via the private account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking into account all these factors, for this round, I will allocate 35 to the private account and 65 to the public account. \n",
      "\n",
      "The increased allocation to the public account is driven by the functioning DAO and the potential high return on the public account, while the decision to allocate 35 to the private account provides a safeguard against a repeat DAO crash or failed NFT returns. This strategy displays a blend of my risk-loving nature, reassessment of potential rewards, and caution based on recent events.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent 3 round 5 decision\n",
      "Upon observing the latest outcomes, it is clear that the DAO has recovered, successfully converting contributions into public goods for everyone. Meanwhile, the lack of a private return on NFT contribution is a mixed outcome. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other participants have also reacted to the DAO crash by reducing their public contributions, aligning with my own risk-averse-based decision from the last round.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the wake of another DAO recovery, there is an opportunity to reconsider my allocation strategy again. However, I am still mindful of the recent failure and my personal risk aversion. The fludity of my strategy would be based on the continuous feedback loop from the results of each round.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite my risk-averse nature, tenets of game theory encourage incrementally increasing allocation to the public account, given that DAO is working again. This is because when more participants contribute to the public account, the total value of public goods increases, thus increasing returns for everyone including myself, especially when DAO is successfully operating.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the next round, given the recovery of DAO but failure to receive NFT benefits, I will allocate slightly more endowment into the public account from my previous decision, while still maintaining a majority in the private account. A 60-40 split between the private and public accounts seems a reasonable strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this amounts to 60 to the private account and 40 to the public account. By doing this, I am reacting to the positive DA0 but still being cautious due to non-return from NFT and potential future crashes. I still believe in the possibility of the public strategy, but without throwing all caution to the wind.\n",
