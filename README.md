## WHAT IS IT?
This model is a public goods simulation model based on the game theory model proposed in the paper introduced in https://decentralizefunding.com. The model used reinforcement learning algorithm to model adaptive agents, while incorporating altruistic motivation and risk preference in the classic linear public goods game. This model can be thought of a model for ONGAESHI (https://ongaeshi.io), which utilizes web3 technology (Non-Fungible-Token) to incentitivize educational donation. 

## HOW IT WORKS
For a detailed design explanation and academic references, please see https://docs.google.com/document/d/19srS3kCm0jyV-zgT1F8FQnRlNiIriX90F-OUcGk9sWA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.lljtwv4lt9j1. 

## HOW TO USE IT
Users may download Netlogo Software from the official website https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml, or just by uploading our model to https://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#https://www.netlogoweb.org/, which requires no downloads other than our ONGAESHI.nlogo model.
Please see the users guide https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iswgSyoIBg4yUVdc3IRX2lG0So7spDqOh5dJeqdxpt0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.4ez8m5iku9j to explore how to play with this model.

## THINGS TO NOTICE
The incentivization increases donation amount, when altruism and pther monetary return are not enough to motivate donation. Paying the incentive rewards with fiat (a legal tender) achieves a stable increase in the donaton level. Paying the incentive rewards with fungible token also increases donation level, but it is prone to the uncertainty inherent in the fungible token reward

## THINGS TO TRY
Try to see if the inclusion of the non-fungible-token incentive reward increases total donation, when the total donation is low without it. Also try to see how the strategy preference of each agent with different risk preferences are affected by the non-fungible-token incentive reward.
